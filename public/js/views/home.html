  <p>Greetings, comrade. <br><br>

    At Free The Books, our love for the written word is a little on the unhealthy side. Seeing our objects of obsession become objects of oppression fills us with revolutionary rage. The tyrant of whom we speak? Only the most heinous of social constructs, the bookshelf. The term shelf life tells you everything you need to know about this travesty. Books are meant to be shared with the world, not hoarded like ingredients with an expiry date. Would you stoop to imprisoning your oldest friend in a straightjacket? If not, then why would you do such a thing to your beloved books?<br><br>

    Don’t agree? That makes you the enemy. <br><br>

    But if glimpsing a Waterstones has you itching to enact divine justice, we are your people. Still, there are a few steps you must take to truly be part of the fold:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You do not talk about Free The Books.</li>
      <li>You DO NOT talk about Free The Books</li>
      <li>If you love them, leave them. Anywhere. We mean books, obviously.</li>
      <li>If you catch a book, always let it go again. This is one situation where commitment phobia is a plus. </li>
      <li>Harming a bookshelf is not vandalism. It’s what they want you to believe. </li>
      <li>Always have an extra box of matches. </li>
      <li>If you own a bookshelf, you will share its fate. </li>
      <li>The fight is never over. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ready to shoulder our righteous cause? Hesitate no more. </p>
